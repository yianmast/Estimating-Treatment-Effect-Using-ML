# Estimating Treatment Effect Using Machine Learning

This project is part of the **AI for Medical Treatment** course by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera. It focuses on analyzing treatment effectiveness using data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving colon cancer patients. We use both traditional statistical techniques and modern machine learning approaches to estimate treatment effects and evaluate model performance.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

We investigate the impact of a chemotherapy treatment (Levamisole + Fluorouracil) on 5-year survival rates in post-surgical colon cancer patients. The analysis involves both empirical and model-based evaluation of treatment effects.

### Topics Covered

- Descriptive statistics and empirical treatment effect calculation
- Risk prediction using logistic regression and decision trees
- Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) estimation using T-learners
- Baseline risk and risk reduction analysis
- Model calibration and discrimination
- C-statistic-for-benefit
- Interpreting treatment effect predictions with ML models

## ðŸ“Š Key Learnings

- Calculated empirical risk differences between treated and untreated groups
- Built logistic regression and tree-based models for outcome prediction
- Implemented and evaluated T-learner for individualized treatment effect estimation
- Interpreted treatment effect heterogeneity using feature importance
- Evaluated models using risk calibration and C-statistic-for-benefit
